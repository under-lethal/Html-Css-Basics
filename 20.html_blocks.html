	<h2>HTML Block an Inline Elements</h2>
	<p>Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default disply value for most elements is block or inline.
	</p>

	<h2>Block-level Elements</h2>
	<p>A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (streches out the left and right as far as it can).<br>
	The &lt;div&gt; element is a block-level element.<br>
	Examples of block-levels elements:
	<ul>
		<li>&lt;div&gt;</li>
		<li>&lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;</li>
		<li>&lt;p&gt;</li>
		<li>&lt;form&gt;</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<h2>Inline Elements</h2>
	<p>An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
	<p id="x01"> This is an inline < span> element inside a paragraph.<br> 
	Examples of inline elements:
	<ul>
		<li> < span ></li>
		<li> < a ></li>
		<li> < img ></li>
	</ul>
	</p>
