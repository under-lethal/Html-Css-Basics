	<h2>HTML Encoding (Character Sets)</h2>
	<p>To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must knok which character set (character encoding) to use.</p>

	<h2>What is Character Encoding?</h2>
	<p> ASCII was the first <b>character encoding standard</b>.<br>
	 ASCII defined 127 different alphanumeric characters characters that could be used on the internet: no.(0-9), English letters (A-Z), and some special characters lke !@#$%< >.
	 NASI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set, wth support for 256 different character codes.<br>
	 ISO-8895-1 was the default character set for HTML4. This Character set also supported 256 different character codes.<br>
	 <b>Because ANSI and ISO-8859-1 were so limited, the defaul character encoding was changed to UTF-8 in HTML5.</b><br>
	 UTF-8 (Unicode) covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world.
	 </p>

	 <h2>The HTML charset Attribute</h2>
	 <p>To displayan HTML page corectly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page.
	 This is specified in the < meta > tag:
	  < meta charset="UTF-8">
	*If a browser detects ISO-8859-1 in a web page, it defaults to ANSI, because ANSI is identical to ISO-8859-1 except that ANSI has 32 extra characters.
